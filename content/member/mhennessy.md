Matt is currently a Hooke Research Fellow at the Mathematical Institute at the University of Oxford. From 2016-2018, he was a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Fellow at the Centre de Recerca Matematica just outside of Barcelona. From 2014-2016 he was a post-doctoral research associate in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Imperial College London.

Matt is interested in mathematical modelling physical systems using continuum mechanics. He has particular interest in: soft matter, polymer networks, and hydrogels; instability-driven patterning; phase change and phase separation; poroelasticity; nanoscale heat transfer; and lithium-ion batteries. The models are studied using asymptotic methods and numerical simulations.
