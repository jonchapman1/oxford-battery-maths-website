Matt is currently a Hooke Research Fellow at the Mathematical Institute at the University of Oxford. From 2016-2018, he was a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Fellow at the Centre de Recerca Matematica just outside of Barcelona and. From 2014-2016 he was a post-doctoral research associate in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Imperial College London.

Matt is interested in developing mathematical models of physical systems involving continuum mechanics, heat and mass transport, and interfacial phenomena. Once a suitable model has been formulated, it is analysed using a combination of asymptotic and numerical methods. He has particular interest in structure formation in complex media; instability-driven patterning; nonlinear poroelasticity; swelling of hydrogels and polymer networks; surface growth; nanoscale heat transfer and phase change; and lithium-ion battery modelling.
