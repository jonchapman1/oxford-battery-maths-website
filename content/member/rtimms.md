Robert is currently a Postdoctoral Research Assistant at the Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford. His research focuses on the Mathematical Modelling of Batteries, and is being conducted within the Multi-Scale Mathematical Modelling Fast Start Project of the Faraday Institution.

Robert gained his PhD from the University of East Anglia in 2018, where he worked on problems related to the safe handling of energetic materials. His research utilised asymptotic and numerical techniques to develop and solve partial differential equation models describing the response of such materials to external mechanical stimuli. More generally, Robert is interested in the use of asymptotic methods applied to practical problems arising from industry which couple mechanics, heat flow and chemistry.
