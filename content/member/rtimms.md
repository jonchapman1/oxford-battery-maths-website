Robert is currently a Postdoctoral Research Assistant at the Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford. His research focuses on the Mathematical Modelling of Batteries, and is being conducted within the Multi-Scale Mathematical Modelling Fast Start Project of the Faraday Institution.

Robert gained his PhD from the University of East Anglia in 2018, specialising in the use of asymptotic and numerical techniques to develop and solve partial differential equation models of practical problems arising from industry. He is highly experienced in the use of asymptotic methods applied to problems which couple mechanics, heat flow and chemistry, and also has significant experience liaising with industry to direct research aims and develop impact from research outcomes.
