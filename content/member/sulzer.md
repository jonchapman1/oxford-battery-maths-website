Tino completed a DPhil in Applied Mathematics in 2019. His research is in industrial mathematics, with a focus on electrochemical modelling and asymptotic analysis.
For his DPhil, he worked in collaboration with BBOXX to model charge and discharge of lead-acid batteries for off-grid applications in sub-Saharan Africa.

He is passionate about using mathematical modelling to create smarter batteries and accelerate the development of renewable energy solutions.
In particular, he believes that simplified electrochemical models, such as the single-particle model, are crucial to bridge the gap between equivalent-circuit models (fast but physically inaccurate) and physics-based models (accurate but prohibitively complex). He is also particularly keen on developing open-source software to improve collaboration and maximise research impact.
