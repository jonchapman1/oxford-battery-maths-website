short_bio = "Scott Marquis is a DPhil student in the Industrially Focused Mathematical Modelling (InFoMM) centre for doctoral training (CDT). He is working in collaboration with Siemens to develop models of the long-term degradation of lithium-ion batteries. His research focuses on the development of novel mathematical models of key degradataion mechanisms (e.g. solid electrolye interphase (SEI) growth) and the employment of asymptotic methods to systematically reduce lithium-ion battery models. By integrating his degradation and reduced models he aims to provide a fast and efficient method for studying long-term degradation. He is also a key member of the core [PyBaMM](https://github.com/tinosulzer/PyBaMM) development team"
