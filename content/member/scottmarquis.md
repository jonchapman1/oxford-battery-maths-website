Scott is a DPhil student in Applied Mathematics. He is working in collaboration with Siemens on the mathematical modelling of lithium-ion batteries. His research focuses on the development of reduced-order mathematical models of lithium-ion batteries, which reproduce the behaviour of detailed full-ordered models at a fraction of the computational costs. A key output of his research has been the development of the asymptotic single particle model with electrolyte (SPMe), which is more accurate than all other reduced-order models of equivalent computational complexity. He is also a key member of the core [PyBaMM](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM) development team.
