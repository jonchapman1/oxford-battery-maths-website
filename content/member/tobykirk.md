Toby is currently a Postdoctoral Research Assistant in the Mathematical Institute at the University of Oxford, and part of the Multi-Scale Mathematical Modelling Fast Start Project of the Faraday Institution. His current research is using asymptotic methods to account for electrode heterogeneity in lithium-ion battery models.

He earned his PhD in fluid dynamics under Prof. D. T. Papageorgiou at Imperial College London, studying modern micro-structured (i.e. superhydrophobic) slip surfaces. Using asymptotic and complex methods, he investigated their possible implications for viscous flows, convection, and the nonlinear interfacial dynamics of thin films.
