Alexander is a DPhil student in partial differential equations specialising in finite element analysis.
He working in collaboration with the Monroe group to formulate a general, multi-physical  numerical framework for modelling electrolyte transport within a variety of potential future chemistries for batteries.  Particular attention is paid to  exploiting and preserving the thermodynamic structure of the problem. This approach has allowed for robust multi-dimensional simulations on complex geometries and the introduction of physics typically ignored in most simulations, such as pressure and momentum.
