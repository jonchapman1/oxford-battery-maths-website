My research focuses on mathematically modelling anode particles containing silicon. Silicon has a large capacity for lithium but expands up to four times its original size upon lithiation. This causes high stresses inside the anode, which can cause cracks and result in severe capacity fade. I use a solid mechanics model coupled to a diffusion model for the lithium transport to research the interplay between the lithiation and the stresses induced. I also use homogenisation to study the effect that changes to the design of nano-particles has on the macroscale behaviour of an anode consisting of agglomerated nano-particles.
