Ian completed a DPhil as part of the Industrially Focused Mathematical Modelling (InFoMM) CDT at Oxford. Ian's research focused on the mathematically modelling anode particles containing silicon. Silicon has a large capacity for lithium but expands up to four times its original size upon lithiation. This causes high stresses inside the anode, which can cause cracks and result in severe capacity fade. Ian's mathematical model incorporated solid mechanics coupled to a diffusion model for the lithium transport to research the interplay between the lithiation and the induced stresses. One main feature of his model is the presence of stress-assisted diffusion. Ian also applied a homogenisation technique called the method of multiple scales to study the effect that changing a nano-particle design has on the macroscale behaviour of an anode consisting of agglomerated nano-particles.
