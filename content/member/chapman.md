Jon Chapman was appointed to the 
Chair in Mathematics and its Applications in 1999.

His research interests centre on mathematical modelling and asymptotic
analysis, with applications in industry and the physical and
biological sciences, using mainly partial differential equations.
In the battery area he is interested in the modelling and analysis of both lithium ion and lead acid batteries, including mechanical stress due to swelling, thermal effects, and  degradation mechanisms, as well as electrochemical effects.
