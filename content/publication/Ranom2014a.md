abstract = "In this study, we discuss a lithium battery model based on dilute electrolyte theory and fast diffusion of lithium in the electrode particle and calculate some novel solutions to the model. We then discuss moderately concentrated electrolyte theory and outline how homogenisation techniques can be applied to this theory, in combination with a microscale model for lithium transport in the electrode particles in order to derive a Newman type model of the battery. We formulate a numerical method, based on the method of lines in order to solve this model, and apply it to the cases of a half cell graphite anode and a half cell LiFePO 4 cathode. In both scenarios, the results show very good agreement to experimental discharge curves."
