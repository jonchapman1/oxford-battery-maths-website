abstract = "A mathematical model for the galvanostatic discharge and recovery of porous, electrolytic manganese dioxide cathodes, similar to those found within primary alkaline batteries is presented. The phenomena associated with discharge are modeled over three distinct size scales, a cathodic (or macroscopic) scale, a porous manganese oxide particle (or microscopic) scale, and a manganese oxide crystal (or submicroscopic) scale. The physical and chemical coupling between these size scales is included in the model. In addition, the model explicitly accounts for the graphite phase within the cathode. The effects that manganese oxide particle size and proton diffusion have on cathodic discharge and the effects of intraparticle voids and microporous electrode structure are predicted using the model."
