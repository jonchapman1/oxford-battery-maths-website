abstract = "As the UK battery modelling community grows, there is a clear need for software that uses modern software engineering techniques to facilitate cross-institutional collaboration and democratise research progress. The Python package PyBaMM aims to provide a flexible platform for implementation and comparison of new models and numerical methods. This is achieved by implementing models as expression trees and processing them in a modular fashion through a pipeline. Comprehensive testing provides robustness to changes and hence eases the implementation of model extensions. PyBaMM is open source and available on GitHub at https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM."
