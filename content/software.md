## PyBaMM (**Py**thon **Ba**ttery **M**athematical **M**odelling)

[PyBaMM](https://www.pybamm.org) is a unique and versatile battery modelling package for python produced by a consortium of academics connected through the [Faraday Institution](https://www.faraday.ac.uk/). Its mission is to accelerate battery modelling research by providing an open-source framework for multi-institutional, interdisciplinary collaboration. The development of PyBaMM has been driven by a need within the battery community for a modelling software that is **reliable**, **flexible**, and **efficient**. The Oxford Battery Modelling group has played a central role in the development of PyBaMM, drawing upon our unique skill base to satisfy the key requirements of the battery community.

## **Reliable**
- modern professional software engineering techniques
- test driven development
- modular code base for easy updating and testing
- professional software engineers within the core PyBaMM development team
- well documented

## **Flexible**
- open source
- collection of inbuilt models and solvers to provide user with choice
- submodel structure allows for simple integration of new physics
- modular code base separates models, parameterisation, discretisation and solver so that each can be selected independently 
- user-friendly python codebase

## **Efficient**
- passes computationally expensive operations to lower level programming languages (e.g. C)
- includes accurate reduced-order models suitable for many applications
- uses automatic differentiation to compute the Jacobian for any model, greatly improving solver performance
