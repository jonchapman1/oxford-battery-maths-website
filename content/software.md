## PyBaMM (**Py**thon **Ba**ttery **M**athematical **M**odelling)

[PyBaMM](https://github.com/pybamm-team/PyBaMM) is a unique and versatile battery modelling package for python produced by a consortium of academics connected through the [Faraday Institution](https://faraday.ac.uk/). PyBaMM's development has been driven by a need within the battery community for a modelling software that is **reliable**, **flexible**, and **efficient**. The Oxford Battery Modelling group has played a central role in the development of PyBaMM, drawing upon our unique skill base to satisfy the key requirements of the battery community.

## **Reliable**
- modern professional software engineering techniques
- test driven development
- modular code base for easy updating and testing
- professional software engineers within the core PyBaMM development team
- well documented

## **Flexible**
- use of syntax tree allows simple integration of new physics
- many inbuilt models and solvers to provide user with choice
- modular code base allows for easy chop and change of any section (e.g. write your own solver)
- open source so anything can be modified
- written in python which is simple and means it is easy to modify code
- well documented

## **Efficient**
- Passes computationally expensive operations to lower level programming languages (e.g. C)
- A range of accurate inbuilt our unique reduced order asymptotic models for many situations
- Employment of advanced modern numerical analysis techniques (Alex)
