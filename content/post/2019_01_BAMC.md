Several members of the Oxford Mathematical Modelling Battery Group have been accepted to give talks at the [British Applied Mathematics Colloquium 2019] (https://www.bath.ac.uk/events/british-applied-mathematics-colloquium-2019/) held in April 2019 in Bath. The minisymposium was organised by collaborator Jamie Foster.

DPhil student [Scott Marquis] (/member/marquis) will be talking about his recent research towards in lithium-ion battery degradation. Post-doctoral fellow [Matt Hennessy] (/member/mhennessy) will be talking about asymptotically reducing models for lithium-ion batteries, [Toby Kirk](/member/tkirk) will be talking about his research in particle size distributions and [Robert Timms] (/member/rtimms) will be talking about incorporating temperature differences into lithium-ion models. Faculty member [Jon Chapman] (/member/chapman) will be also be attending, talking about the impact of the battery research occurring at the Mathematical Institute.
