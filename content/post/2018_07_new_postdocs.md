The group is looking forward to welcoming three new postdoctoral researchers, [Matt Hennessy](/member/mhennessy), [Toby Kirk](/member/tkirk) and [Robert Timms](/member/rtimms).

## Matt Hennessy

Matt is joining the group from Barcelona, where he held a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship to work on mathematical modelling of nanoscale heat transfer and phase change with Tim Myers. During his time in Barcelona he began using asymptotic methods to derive simplified models of lithium-ion batteries. He plans to continue this work in Oxford while also focusing on issues relating to heat generation, degradation, short circuiting, and nanowire-based anodes.
