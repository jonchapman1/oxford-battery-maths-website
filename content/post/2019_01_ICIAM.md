Several members of the Oxford Mathematical Modelling Battery Group have been accepted to give talks at the [International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics] (https://iciam2019.org/) held in July 2019 in Valencia, Spain. 

DPhil students [Scott Marquis] (/member/marquis), [Ian Roper] (/member/roper) and [Valentin Sulzer] (/member/roper) will be talking about their recent research towards their DPhil projects; Post-doctoral fellows [Matt Hennessy] (/member/mhennessy), [Toby Kirk](/member/tkirk) and [Robert Timms] (/member/rtimms) will be talking about the research they have carried out so far at Oxford and faculty member [Jon Chapman] (/member/chapman) will be talking about the impact of the battery research at the Mathematical Institute.

We look forward to sharing our research with all attendees and finding out more about battery modelling going on at other institutions!
