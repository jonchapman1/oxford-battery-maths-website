      <description>Valentin Sulzer, Jon Chapman and Colin Please have submitted a two-part paper to ECS on &amp;lsquo;Faster Lead-Acid Battery Simulations from Porous-Electrode Theory&amp;rsquo;, now available on ArXiv [part I, part II].
I. Physical Model An isothermal porous-electrode model of a discharging lead-acid battery is presented, which includes an extension of concentrated-solution theory that accounts for excluded-volume effects, local pressure variation, and a detailed microscopic water balance. The approach accounts for three typically neglected physical phenomena: convection, pressure diffusion, and variation of liquid volume with state of charge.</description>

      <description>The group is looking forward to welcoming three new postdoctoral researchers, Matt Hennessy, Toby Kirk and Robert Timms.
Matt Hennessy Matt is joining the group from Barcelona, where he held a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship to work on mathematical modelling of nanoscale heat transfer and phase change with Tim Myers. During his time in Barcelona he began using asymptotic methods to derive simplified models of lithium-ion batteries. He plans to continue this work in Oxford while also focusing on issues relating to heat generation, degradation, short circuiting, and nanowire-based anodes.</description>

      <description>Toby is currently a Postdoctoral Research Assistant in the Mathematical Institute at the University of Oxford, and part of the Multi-Scale Mathematical Modelling Fast Start Project of the Faraday Institution. His current research is using asymptotic methods to account for electrode heterogeneity in lithium-ion battery models.
He earned his PhD in fluid dynamics under Prof. D. T. Papageorgiou at Imperial College London, studying modern micro-structured (i.e. superhydrophobic) slip surfaces. Using asymptotic and complex methods, he investigated their possible implications for viscous flows, convection, and the nonlinear interfacial dynamics of thin films.</description>

      <description>Ian&amp;rsquo;s research focuses on mathematically modelling anode particles containing silicon. Silicon has a large capacity for lithium but expands up to four times its original size upon lithiation. This causes high stresses inside the anode, which can cause cracks and result in severe capacity fade. Ian&amp;rsquo;s mathematical model incorporates solid mechanics coupled to a diffusion model for the lithium transport to research the interplay between the lithiation and the induced stresses.</description>

      <description>PyBaMM Python Battery Mathematical Modelling Pybamm is a unique and versatile battery modelling package for python produced by a consortium of academics connected through the Faraday Institution. PyBaMM&amp;rsquo;s development has been driven by a need within the battery community for a modelling software which is reliable, flexible, and efficient. The Oxford Battery Modelling group has played a central role in the core development of PyBaMM, drawing upon our unique skill base to satisfy the key requirements of the battery community.</description>

      <description>Scott is a DPhil student in Applied Mathematics. He is working in collaboration with Siemens to develop models of the long-term degradation of lithium-ion batteries. His research focuses on the development of novel mathematical models of key degradataion mechanisms (e.g. solid electrolye interphase (SEI) growth) and the employment of asymptotic methods to systematically reduce lithium-ion battery models. By integrating his degradation and reduced models he aims to provide a fast and efficient method for studying long-term degradation.</description>

      <description>Tino is a DPhil Candidate in Applied Mathematics at the University of Oxford. His research is in industrial mathematics, with a focus on electrochemical modelling and asymptotic analysis. For his DPhil, he is working with BBOXX to model charge and discharge of lead-acid batteries for off-grid applications in sub-Saharan Africa.
He is am passionate about using mathematical modelling to create smarter batteries and accelerate the development of renewable energy solutions. In particular, he believes that simplified electrochemical models, such as the single-particle model, are crucial to bridge the gap between equivalent-circuit models (fast but physically inaccurate) and physics-based models (accurate but prohibitively complex).</description>
