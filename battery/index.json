We model lithium concentration in both the solid and fluid phase along with solid and liquid electric potential.  Through asymptotic reduction, we show that the electric potentials are spatially homogeneous which decouples the problem into a series of time-dependent problems.  These problems can be solved on three distinguished time scales, an early time scale where capacitance effects in the electrode dominate, a mid-range time scale where a spatial concentration gradient forms in the electrolyte, and a long-time scale where each of the electrodes saturate and deplete with lithium respectively.  The solid-phase concentration profiles are linear functions of time and the electrolyte potential is everywhere zero, which allows the model to be reduced to a system of two uncoupled ordinary differential equations. Analytic and numerical results are compared with full numerical simulations and experimental discharge curves demonstrating excellent agreement.","tags":null,"title":"Asymptotic reduction of a porous electrode model for lithium-ion batteries","type":"publication"},{"authors":[{"is_member":true,"link":"/sulzer","name":"Valentin Sulzer"}],"categories":null,"content":" Valentin Sulzer, Jon Chapman and Colin Please have submitted a two-part paper to ECS on \u0026lsquo;Faster Lead-Acid Battery Simulations from Porous-Electrode Theory\u0026rsquo;, now available on ArXiv [part I, part II].\nI.

However, for some physical systems this sharp divide is not present, and so a better model is needed to capture a transition region for the reaction. We are interested in large particles made of many small grains where there are strong interactions between microscale granular and macroscale particulate effects, and where a shrinking core model represents behavior at the microscale level. We obtain homogenized equations for macroscale behavior by exploiting the small ratio of granular to particle lengthscales. These macroscale equations allow for a diffuse reaction front, as well as a sharp interface between reacted and unreacted solid material. We analyze the resulting model asymptotically in the limits where the reaction time is rate-limited by chemical kinetics, and separately by diffusion, determining the thickness of the reaction front. Numerical simulations support the law of additive reaction times, which states that the total reaction time is given as the sum of the conversion times under these limits. We further show how the model results can be extended to incorporate the transport of the product gas out of the solid particle, using a binary Fickian diffusion model. In metallurgical production the particle size and porosity are known to influence reaction times. Our results help quantify these effects and may be an aid in raw material selection.","tags":null,"title":"Homogenization of a Shrinking Core Model for Gas-Solid Reactions in Granular Particles","type":"publication"},{"authors":[{"is_member":true,"link":"/roper","name":"Ian Roper"}],"categories":null,"content":"Several members of the Oxford Mathematical Modelling Battery Group have been accepted to give talks at the International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics held in July 2019 in Valencia, Spain.\nDPhil students Scott Marquis, Ian Roper and Valentin Sulzer will be talking about their recent research towards their DPhil projects; Post-doctoral fellows Matt Hennessy, Toby Kirk and Robert Timms will be talking about the research they have carried out so far at Oxford and faculty member Jon Chapman will be talking about the impact of the battery research at the Mathematical Institute.\nWe look forward to sharing our research with all attendees and finding out more about battery modelling going on at other institutions!\n","date":1547683200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550682086,"objectID":"975a54c643c884208cd6ea279f733150","permalink":"http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/chapman/battery/post/2019_01_iciam/","publishdate":"2019-01-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019_01_iciam/","section":"post","summary":"Several members of the Oxford Mathematical Modelling Battery Group have been accepted to give talks at the International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics held in July 2019 in Valencia, Spain.\nDPhil students Scott Marquis, Ian Roper and Valentin Sulzer will be talking about their recent research towards their DPhil projects; Post-doctoral fellows Matt Hennessy, Toby Kirk and Robert Timms will be talking about the research they have carried out so far at Oxford and faculty member Jon Chapman will be talking about the impact of the battery research at the Mathematical Institute.","tags":null,"title":"Speakers at ICIAM","type":"post"},{"authors":[{"is_member":true,"link":"/roper","name":"Ian Roper"}],"categories":null,"content":"Several members of the Oxford Mathematical Modelling Battery Group have been accepted to give talks at the British Applied Mathematics Colloquium 2019 held in April 2019 in Bath.

Using a rigorous scaling analysis, we then show how the model can be systematically reduced to a pair of equivalent circuit models and, importantly, provide three simple conditions that are required for the reduction to be valid. Since the reduced model is derived from a detailed electrochemical model, it is based on physical parameters rather than empirical equivalent circuit parameters. The reduced model consists of two first-order ordinary differential equations for the solid-phase electric potentials and can be straightforwardly simulated using traditional fast methods. This makes the reduced model ideal for use in battery management systems and for parameter estimation and optimisation. Finally, we validate the reduced model against three sets of experimental data and large-scale numerical simulations and find excellent agreement in all cases.","tags":null,"title":"An experimentally validated equivalent circuit model for lithium-ion batteries systematically derived from porous electrode theory","type":"publication"},{"authors":[{"is_member":true,"link":"/chapman","name":"Jon Chapman"},{"is_member":true,"link":"/please","name":"Colin Please"}],"categories":null,"content":" The group is looking forward to welcoming three new postdoctoral researchers, Matt Hennessy, Toby Kirk and Robert Timms.\nMatt Hennessy Matt is joining the group from Barcelona, where he held a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship to work on mathematical modelling of nanoscale heat transfer and phase change with Tim Myers.

Two common mistakes found in the literature regarding a sign in a boundary conditions and the use of the transfer coefficient are mentioned. The paper focuses on the form of the Butler-Volmer equation in the model. It is shown how practical problems can be avoided by taking care in the form used, particularly to avoid difficulties when the solid particle in the electrodes approaches a fully charged or discharged state or the electrolyte gets depleted. This shows that the open circuit voltage and the exchange current density must depend on the lithium concentration in both the solid and the electrolyte in a particular way at the extremes of the concentration ranges.","tags":null,"title":"Some comments on the Butler-Volmer equation for modeling Lithium-ion batteries","type":"publication"},{"authors":[{"is_member":false,"name":"Jeevanjyoti Chakraborty"},{"is_member":true,"link":"/please","name":"Colin P.

For a cylindrical particle such growth may also lead to failure by buckling if the expansion is constrained in the axial direction due to other particles or supporting structures. To mitigate this problem, the possibility of reducing axial growth is investigated theoretically by studying simple modifications of the solid cylinder geometry. First, an annular cylinder is considered with lithiation either from the inside or from the outside. In both cases, the reduction of axial growth is not found to be significant. Next, explicit physical constraints are studied by addition of a non-growing elasto-plastic material: first, an outer annular constraint on a solid silicon cylinder, and second a rod-like inner constraint for an annular silicon cylinder. In both cases, it is found that axial growth can be reduced if the yield stress of the constraining material is significantly higher than that of silicon and/or the thickness of the constraint is relatively high. Phase diagrams are presented for both the outer and the inner constraint cases to identify desirable operating zones. Finally, to interpret the phase diagrams and isolate the key physical principles two different simplified models are presented and are shown to recover important qualitative trends of the numerical simulation results.","tags":null,"title":"Influence of constraints on axial growth reduction of cylindrical Li-ion battery electrode particles","type":"publication"},{"authors":[{"is_member":false,"name":"Jeevanjyoti Chakraborty"},{"is_member":true,"link":"/please","name":"Colin P.

The two-way coupling between stress and concentration of lithium in silicon, including the possibility of plastic deformation, is taken into account and two particular cases are considered. First, the cylindrical particle is assumed to be free of surface traction and second, the axial deformation of the cylinder is prevented. In both cases plastic stretches develop through the entire cylinder and not just near the surface as is commonly found in spherical anode particles. It is shown that the stress evolution depends both on the lithiation rate and the external constraints. Furthermore, as the cylinder expands during lithiation it can develop a compressive axial stress large enough to induce buckling, which in turn may lead to mechanical failure. An explicit criterion for swelling-induced buckling obtained as a modification of the classical Euler buckling criterion shows the competition between the stabilising effect of radius increase and the destabilising effect of axial stress.","tags":null,"title":"Combining mechanical and chemical effects in the deformation and failure of a cylindrical electrode particle in a Li-ion battery","type":"publication"},{"authors":[{"is_member":false,"name":"G.

Exploiting the small size of the particles relative to the electrode dimensions, a homogenised model (in agreement with existing theories) is systematically derived and studied. Details of how the various averaged quantities relate to the underlying geometry and assumptions are given. The novel feature of the homogenisation process is that it allows the coefficients in the electrode-scale model to be derived in terms of the microscopic features of the electrode (e.g. particle size and shape) and can thus be used as a systematicway of investigating the effects of changes in particle design. Asymptotic methods are utilised to further simplify the model so that one-dimensional behaviour can be described with relatively simpler expressions. It is found that for low discharge currents, the battery acts almost uniformly while above a critical current, regions of the battery become depleted of lithium ions and have greatly reduced reaction rates leading to spatially nonuniform use of the electrode. The asymptotic approximations are valid for electrode materials where the OCV is a strong function of intercalated lithium concentration, such as LixC6, but not formaterials with a flat discharge curve, such as LiFePO4.","tags":null,"title":"Multiscale modelling and analysis of lithium-ion battery charge and discharge","type":"publication"},{"authors":[{"is_member":true,"link":"/please","name":"C.P.

Oxford University is a founding partner of the Faraday Institution – the UK’s independent institute for electrochemical energy storage research. This partnership has allowed us to develop exciting research links with a number of Universities and industrial bodies across the UK.\nA large portion of our research focuses on lithium-ion batteries, which are one of the most widely used technologies for energy storage, with applications ranging from portable electronics to electric vehicles. Due to their popularity, there is a continued interest in the development of mathematical models of lithium-ion batteries for many different purposes. These models can be broadly categorised into two groups: equivalent circuit models, which aim to describe battery behaviour by making an analogy with traditional circuit components such as resistors and capacitors; and electrochemical models, which aim to describe the physical processes of mass and charge transport within the cell. Equivalent circuit models can be solved rapidly on cheap computing hardware, making them the ideal choice for real-time battery management applications. However, they provide limited physical insight into battery behaviour. On the other hand, electrochemical models are computationally expensive, but provide a much more detailed description of the internal physics of battery operation which can be used for improving cell design.\nStarting with complicated electrochemical models and exploiting asymptotic analysis, we systematically derive simplified physics-based models, which provide a useful theoretical middle ground to support battery management, on-line diagnostics, and cell design. By exploiting physically relevant limits we can a develop a suite of simplified models, whose complexity and fidelity can be selected to best meet the user’s needs. The approach provides a general framework for developing so-called reduced-order models which can be extended to incorporate additional important physical effects such as mechanics (how does the cell swell and shrink during charge and discharge?), thermal effects (how does the battery heat up during use?), and degradation mechanisms (what causes the cell to lose capacity over its lifetime?).\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559215324,"objectID":"42f623b3bad309d5d6619d450af47d40","permalink":"http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/chapman/battery/research/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"The Mathematical Institute is home to a vibrant battery research community, encompassing a number of research topics including asymptotic analysis and numerical methodologies applied to the partial differential equations that describe electrochemical behaviour, mechanics of cell charge and discharge, and thermal effects during battery operation.
